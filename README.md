# CMS. 611 (Creating Video Games) Project - Concurrent Chase

We started our code with base code from: https://github.mit.edu/MITGameLab/unity-game-design-intro.

# Versioning
The project was created with Unity 2021.3.5f1, a Long Term Support version and with editor Version: 6000.2.6f1

# Packages
The project replaces the default Unity Input class with the newer Input System package.

# Global settings
Uses the newer Input System package with the Update Mode set to Fixed Update.  This means that input processing should occur on a regular drumbeat in FixedUpdate() rather than in the frame-rate-dependent Update().
